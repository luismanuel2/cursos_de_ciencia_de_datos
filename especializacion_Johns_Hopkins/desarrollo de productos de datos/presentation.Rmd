## objective

the objective is to create a shiny app with the following characteristics:

1.  Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
2.  Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
3.  Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4.  You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
5.  The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

## description of the app

This app fits a polynomial model to a data set composed of a variable $x$ and a variable $y$, the polynomial can be up to degree 4 and the user can choose how many data the model will fit, it is also you can make a prediction of $y$ given a value of $x$.

**note: the data was made up**
