this application creates a polynomial regression model fitted to the selected data, when the application is opened it fits a linear regression model to all the data in the graph:

then you can change the degree of the polynomial with the slider bar, for example let's fit a polynomial of degree 4

If you only want to fit a model to some data, just place the mouse on the graph and select the data you want, for example let's create a grade 2 graph with a few data

The slider bar named "value of x" is used to create a prediction from the generated model, so you can choose any value between -6 and 6 and the estimate of $y$ is returned, for example from the previously generated model we are going to predict the value of $y$ given a value of $x = -3$

Checkboxes are used to show or hide the equation of the model and the prediction
